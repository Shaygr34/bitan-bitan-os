# CLAUDE.md — Project Rules

## Core principles

1. **Web-first**: all tools, deployments, and workflows must work in the browser. No local-only toolchains.
2. **No secrets in code**: credentials go in environment variables or a secrets manager. Never commit `.env` files, API keys, or tokens.
3. **Small PRs**: one concern per pull request. If a PR description needs more than 3 bullet points, split it.
4. **Auditability**: every non-trivial decision gets an entry in `docs/01_decision_log.md` with date, context, and rationale.
5. **Role separation**: each app (`os-hub`, `sumit-sync`, `content-engine`) has a clear owner. Cross-cutting changes require review from both sides.
6. **Staging required**: all changes must pass a staging environment before merging to production. No YOLO deploys.

## Workflow

- Branch from `main`, open a PR, get review, merge.
- CI must pass before merge.
- Use conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).

## Code style

- Follow the linter configuration in each app.
- Prefer explicit over clever.
- Write tests for new functionality.

## Design & Style Enforcement

- All UI must comply with `docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE_SYSTEM.md` — use only defined tokens and components.
- All implementation must comply with `docs/STYLE_CONTRACT.md` — no hard-coded values, follow naming conventions.
- If unsure about a design or style decision, create an explicit `<!-- TODO: ... -->` with your assumption and flag it in the PR.
- No new UI without referencing tokens/components defined in the Design Language System.
